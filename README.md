# CS 52 Short Assignment 1

This repo is an updated version of a personal website that I made for myself when I did the DALI mappy challenge (https://github.com/dali-lab/mappy/blob/gh-pages/docs/dev_details.md) during 17W. 

When I registered the domain danahhan.me again for this short assignment using an email alias, it brought back my personal website that had expired in the past. I then updated some of the details to make it relevant for the present day. Enjoy!
