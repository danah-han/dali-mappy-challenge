          Hello! My name is Danah Han and I'm a freshman at Dartmouth
          College, hailing originally from Long Island, NY. I currently plan on majoring in Computer Science.

          I view development as an outlet through which I can fuse my interests in
          art and technology. I love the methodical and creative process of using
          code to build structure, then using art and design to add my own style
          to the final product.
