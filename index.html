          Hello! My name is Danah Han and I'm a freshman at Dartmouth
          College, hailing originally from Long Island, NY. I currently plan on majoring in Computer Science and
          minoring in Digital Arts and Human-Centered Design.

          I view development as an outlet through which I can fuse my interests in
          art and technology. I love the methodical and creative process of using
          code to build structure, then using art and design to add my own style
          to the final product. My primary interests lie in website and iOS app development.

          Working at the DALI Lab provides the exciting
          opportunity to continue exploring the intersections of design and development.
          Over the course of my first term at DALI, I'm excited for the growth I will experience
          in those two areas and to see how my current skill set expands and improves.
          It also doesn't hurt that the lab is a really cool space that reminds me of
