          Hello! My name is Danah Han and I'm a '20 from Long
          Island, NY. I currently plan on majoring in Computer Science and
          minoring in Digital Arts and Human-Centered Design.

          I view development as an outlet through which I can fuse my interests in
          art and technology. I love the methodical and creative process of using
          code to build structure, then using art and design to add my own style
          to the final product. My primary interests lie in website and iOS app development.

          Working at Pinterest would provide the exciting opportunity to continue
          my growth as a developer all while learning about what it is really like
          to be a software engineer. I greatly admire the mission of Pinterest
          and I hope to see my current skill set expand and improve.
